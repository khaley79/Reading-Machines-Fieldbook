#Week 7

Garvey, Ellen Gruber. “Book, Paper, Scissors: An Introduction to Nineteenth-Century Scrapbooks.” _Writing with Scissors_, Oxford University Press, 2013.

Garvey's introduction about the history of scrapbooking presented a hidden past to a much maligned hobby. She presents an interesting overview of the scrapbook, with the most interesting aspect being the negative gendering connotations attached to women’s scrapbooks. Garvey notes how “commentators claimed that men’s scrapbooks were models of order, in which statesmen and ministers gathered materials for speeches and sermons. They derided women’s scrapbooks as miscellanies of trivial poetry and household hints” (10). While this dates back several centuries, it seems as if the current view of scrapbooking mirrors this negative gendered connotation. This is evident when Garvey notes “The scrapbooks popular today merge photograph albumns with memorabilia scrapbooks,” thus highlighting how the current form mirrors the negative assumptions made about women’s scrapbooks centuries ago. Even more fascinating, however, is that this switch accompanied the mass commercialization of scrapbooking, “the current wave of scrapbooking began in 1980, set off by an exhibit of Marielen Christiansen’s fifty scrapbooks” which was followed by Christiansen and her husband writing a “how-to book” and their creation of a “scrapbooking supply store, which grew into the multimillion-dollar business Keeping Memories Alive” (19). There’s a lingering suggestion that commercialization and mass production of scrapbooking supplies, something which was previously left to the individual to create, is connected to the feminization of the practice. This would seem to primarily be due to the shift to memorabilia scrapbooking, but the question remains as to why this is viewed as a feminine thing? 

Further, while Garvey gestures towards how certain aspects of scrapbooking persist into the digital technologies, she stops short of really delving into this. This is most likely due to this simply being an introduction, but it’s easy to look at social media platforms and view them as a form of shared and public scrapbooking. Tumblr, Twitter, even older blogging platforms like Livejournal, are often filled with stories, images, video clips, and more that one finds interesting or useful. However, unlike the older form of scrapbooking, there’s a strong sense of a performative identity attached to these platforms. While Garvey does touch upon this with regards to African American scrapbooking, one wonders about gendered identity construction among the LGBT community when it comes to scrapbooking, especially gien how important the digital version of this has become in our contemporary society.
