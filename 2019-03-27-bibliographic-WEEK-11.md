Matthew Kirschenbaum’s essay, "Extreme Inscription: A Grammatology of the Hard Drive," examines the ways in which the harddrive as a medium functions, by looking into the mechanical, electrical, and technological processes which allow it to perform its day-to-day work. Much of this process is hidden from the average user, and in exposing the underlying processes, Kirschenbaum then examines how the technology affects our lives and the way we interact with data and information. This ranges from highlighting how technology has lead to a hoarder like mentality towards digital data, due to the increasingly low and efficient methods of storage, to the how it has affected the design and running of institutions such as school libraries which are leaning towards “reconfigured to house a state-of-the-art media and information center packed with computers” (100), something which is reflected in recent developments on our own campus. Kirschenbaum’s later turn towards analyzing how data storage reflects ideas of our own humanity raises questions about what makes us who we are and challenges our notion of the self. If all our interactions shift to digital formats and can be encoded, stored, retrieved, rewritten, through digital technology, then we are forced to question our notion of the individual self. Are we the influences which act upon us? Is there an independent personality to us? Issues of nature vs. nurture can be seen, yet questions about alteration are also raised. If we can encode and save our life experiences digitally, what about things which aren't in the record? Did they happen? Issues of memory can be teased out from there as well. If we remember something, but there is no record of it, did it happen? If the record is altered and it doesn’t coincide with our memory, which is accurate? Not being aware of the underlying workings of technology would apparently leave this all open to question as there would be little to no understanding of how such things could be altered or what might cause them. 

The epistemological questions raised by Kirschenbaum are also present in Ellen Gruber Garvey's “facts and FACTS: Abolitionists’ Database Innovations”. In this essay, Garvey examines an early form of data collection and database construction in the form of _Ameican Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses_. The abolitionist book was created by the Grimke family, and was created by compiling thousands of slave ads and combining them with slave testimony to produce a powerful indictment of the inhuman treatment slaves faced. Garvey highlights the way different forms of information can be used in conjunction with one another to affect real world responses and changes. The most notable example of this was how the abolitionist Grimke family used a combination of personal testimony in conjunction with repurposed slave ads is a sterling example of multiple forms of data being used to emphasize and verify an argument. The book was contested as slave owners claimed the information was being manipulated and not reflective of the reality. On a certain level this is true, the information--the recontextualized slave advertisements--was being manipulated, but it was also being confirmed and reinforced through multiple forms of data. Combined with Kirschenbaum, this raises questions about how to push back and resist the possible exploitation and manipulation of data. 

To a certain degree, these questions and issues are on display in the excerpts from Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein's _Data Feminism_. While the primary purpose of the texts were mapping out the intersecting theoretical fields they wished to explore, reading it via the webpage highlighted the way in which digital technology has made book editing a potentially communal experience. Being to able to watch both authors respond to criticism about their project and engage with the audience allowed for a glimpse into both the editing process, but it also served to highlight how their own prejudices or presumptions acted upon their writing to favor certain terminology, factoids, or interpretations of the information available. In this way, the web format of the text reinforced certain aspects of their own essay, and highlighted how it "is about power too. It is about who has power and who doesn’t, about the consequences of those power differentials, and how those power differentials can be challenged and changed." This sense of transparency links addresses the ideas of data manipulation and fairness.

Taken together, these works raise numerous questions about how many different data sources are necessary to verify something as fact? How far can data be manipulated before it becomes invalid? How can data be manipulated fairly, and how does its representation and juxtaposition against other forms of data allow it to function as a rhetorical tool?
