# Lab Report 2

**Prompt**

For this lab report, I want you to to two things. First, to reflect as always on the lab we conducted together. How does working by candlelight help you think about early practices of textual production and the codex format? What new insights are produced by the experience?

Second, I would ask you to choose another format: perhaps something more contemporary, such as a software format, or something related to your own area of research interest. Then, I would ask you to consider—and this might require some brief additional research—a technical or material element that influences the form, production, or use of your format. You have latitude here, but you should be considering something that seems on first glance to stand apart from the content of your format, as the candle perhaps seems separate from the content of the manuscripts produced by its light. What new insight might we glean by considering these elements together, or by widening our lens from a given medium to the technologies or materials central to its expression?


**Actual Lab Report Writing**

Our time attempting to transcibe handwritten documents by candlelight made me appreciate early scrivener’s ability to decipher cursive writing. While the cursive writing may slowly be fading away in our modern era, I underwent my K-12 education at a time when it was still a required part of the curriculum. Despite this, I found myself repeatedly at a loss to interepret what was on the sheet we were transcribing from. The ability of scriveners and those producing things in the codex format, or re-inscribing documents, to interpret multiple types of cursive must have been quite impressive. On the other hand, maybe it wasn’t and many of the texts which have survived through this method are full of errors and changes due to guesses at what a word was. In that case, it makes one wonder what has been lost or altered in the repduction down through the centuries. 

Another aspect that really stood to me, and one which I had a rather unfortunate first hand experience with, was the potential for harm and destruction through the source of illumination (ie. the candle). While attempting to move in my seat I found myself to be stuck or caught up in the rungs of the neighboring chairs. When I attempted to see what the problem was with the candle, some wax dripped on my hand. That was a constant threat for the scriveners working in the dark, or the average reader attempting to read at night. Further, as you (Professor Cordell) mentioned, the most commonly used candle during certain periods tended to sputter and spark. The danger in reading wasn't just eye strain, back strain, but of potentially destroying the works you were attempting to transcribe, or even damaging your place of residence. 

This left me wondering about the fatality rate attached to such acts during this era. How many nighttime fires can be traced to accidents such as these? How many scriveners were injured in this way during their trasncription process? Was there a protocol in place in case of such incidents? Regardless of the answers, the potential risk aspect was not something I had previously considered when thinking about reading or writing in the pre-electric era.

The relationship between different media formats and their physicality or production had my mind immediately turning to the contemporary comic book. After mulling it over a bit, I pushed this idea a bit further and found my thoughts lingering on a very specific comic book format, the Japanese comic magazine. While the juxtaposition of words and pictures in a sequential order is universal in both Japanese and American comic _forms_, the materiality of their serialized _formats_ are vastly different. 

In the United States, the most visible format for comics are the 22-32 page, saddle stitched, full color pamphlets which are released on a monthly basis. This format is the home to well known American comic characters such as Spider-Man, Batman, The X-Men, and more, with a single comic series following the ongoing adventures of a single character or a team of characters. While it’s prominence may have faded over time, this format still holds sway in the cultural conscious, and is most likely the format most people in the U.S. think of when they hear the term “comic book”. Furthermore, the paper stock that most of these comics now use have moved away from the cheaper soft paper to a thicker, glossy stock. This change in paper stock has accompanied by an increase in price, and the average American comic printed in this format now costs between $3-$5. Admittedly, there are many other reasons for the ever increasing price of comics in this format, but it’s impossible to ignore the accompanying change in the materiality of the comic book itself.

This pamphplet format, however, is virutally absent in Japan. Instead, their comics are commonly published in the format of large, cheap, black and white anthologies—a format which has sometimes been compared to phone books by U.S. comic critics and commentators. The typical Japanese comics magazine is between 300―500 pages, and are anthologies which carry a wide variety of serialized series in a single volume. The paper is known for being incredibly cheap, roughly the equivalent of news print. The cheap paper and lack of color has allowed Japanese publisher to print large quantities of their magazines, but offer them at significantly cheaper prices than their American counterparts, $2.50-$5.00 for a single 400 page magazine.

Prior to the spread of smart phone technology, the Japanese format’s cheapness encouraged readers to view them as disposable and it wasn't uncommon for Japanese commuters to leave them on the train after reading them—something which echoes the treatment of newspapers on the MBTA and other forms of public transit. What this meant, is that while their over the counter sale numbers could be incredibly high (nearly 7 million for the most popular magazine at its peak), the number of people reading the magazine could be even higher. The cheap materials used in its production helped popularize the format and helped the content reach a massive audience. Ironically enough, this format and its popularity echoes the format American comics used in the first half of the 20th century, cheap paper and low prices with a large readership who viewed them as disposable entertainment.

Admittedly, the popularity and spread of both forms of comics can be linked to reasons beyond their physical format—differences in cultures and their attitudes to the comics form being the most notable, but aslo differences in distribution as well. However, there does seem to be a connection between forms popularity, and the cheap materiality of its format.
