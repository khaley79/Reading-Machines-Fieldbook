# Lab Report 1

**Prompt**

Your first lab report has a wide mandate, and will give you the chance to experiment with weaving together your ideas from our first week’s reading and discussion with a thoughtful engagement with our first laboratory. Do not try to discuss every reading or point you might; instead, choose 1-2 readings and one central idea to dig into. Use your lab report to bring together theory and praxis, to begin understand doing as a critical and intellectual practice intimately related to thinking or writing. In this case, what might Markdown have to say to our burgeoning understanding of media and materiality?

**Actual Lab Report Writing**

The coding language, Markdown, was created for its ease of use, both in terms of writing with and in terms of reading it. While it lacks to detail and customization of certain markup languages, such as TEI, it does a fantastic job at keeping things simple and clean. As mentioned in class, there are also numerous application across numerous platforms which are able to read the language itself. On one hand this goes into the idea of digital media and the democratization of information, Markdown is simple enough that nearly anyone with access to a computer can use it to compose documents in a short amount of time. However, as a form of digital media, Markdown suffers from the same issues as all digital media. Most notably, it suffers from the issue of decay as described in N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman's introduction to _Comparative Textual Media_. 

In their introduction, Hayles and Pressman provide brief introductions to the essays contained within the collection. One in particular, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum’s, “The .txtual Condition,” was particularly striking and connected to not only potential problems with digital media, but also to the class’s discussion of Github as a form of version control. They highlight Kirschenbaum’s assertion that “digital objects are in a literal sense re-created each time they are accessed, a situation that poses unique problems for keeping detailed records of the data stream flow” (xxv). The cycle of re-creation means that access to the original digital version is not only impossible, but it implies the possibility of the data changing or being altered without one’s awareness. Github, and other types of version control, can be seen as an attempt to resolve this problem by tracking the changes made to the file, wiht some even keeping track of the last time a file was accessed—which in turn could be seen as tracking each re-creation of the file.

The growing use and presence of version control in file management systems, particularly in larger projects, aligns with Kirschenbaum’s call for archival methods to “transform to meet the challenges of born-digital objects, from theory to criteria for best practices to practice itself” (xxv). Unfortunately, though, they seem to be little more than a Band-Aid at best, and do nothing to resolve the underlying issue and cycle of decay and reconstruction. Such a cycle being an inherent aspect of digital has even larger rammifications, beyond the world of archives. Indeed, it's presence could be seen as having an affect on the way we view and value digital data. 

In his essay, “The Medium is the Message,” McLuhan argues that the idea of a neutral technology “is the voice of the current somnambulism” and how the idea “ignores the nature of the medium, of any and all media, in the true Narcissus style of one hypnotized by the amputation and extension of his own being in a new technical form” (11). The idea of a neutral media or medium ignores the fact that the very form it takes can be viewed as having its agency or intent which emerges from it’s very form. He notes that an example of this neutral belief is present in the idea of guns as neither good nor bad, “if the slugs reach the right people firearms are good” (11), a statement which ignore the fact that bullets are intended to harm and kill regardless of who they’re aimed at. What, then, is the intent or message of digital media which constantly destroys and recreates its content, and how does that impact our own opinion of the content we put upon it? 

While the constant presence and ease of access to digital content would seem to suggest a great value, the ephemerality of the medium suggests a devaluation of information. This devaluation can also be seen in the cheapness of digital media. Movies, books, TV series, music, and more are all available for free or for a few dollars, yet the ubiquity only serves to obscure this aspect of digital media. In one sense, digital media now occupies the same role that pulp literature occupied. It is everywhere, yet the design implies consumption rather than durability. You read the magazine, then throw it away, or in the case of digital media, read it and delete it.
