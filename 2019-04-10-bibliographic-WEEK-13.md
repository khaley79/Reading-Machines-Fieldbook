It was difficult to read Jon Bois' "What Football Will Look Like in the Future" and not be struck by the story's discussion of peoples' inability to move on from the familiar. In particular, this short portion about having lived in the same apartment twice, "You know, actually, I went back and looked it up. I'd lived there for two years back in 7174. And I realized I'd arranged the furniture pretty much the same way and everything. Oh God, it was so weird" (Bois). On its own this may not seem like it has much of a connection to the history of books, but the idea of returning to the same place and doing the exact same thing echoes the warning in Busa's text from last week, about using new technology "to do things in the same way as before". We make use of the new technology, not to push the boundaries of what a book can be, but to replicate the experience of reading a traditional, physical book. 

A similar sentiment is found within Craig Mod's article, "Future Reading" which laments the way Amazon has seemingly abandoned development of the Kindle's features and the corporate cordoning off of the digital market. As Mod explains, "Every note I took, every underline I made was contributing to a vast lattice collection of reader knowledge that would someday manifest in ways beautiful or interesting or otherwise yet unknowable. This I believed" (Mod). He further notes how readers "have no control over what software we can use to read it, or what happens to our notes and other meta information culled from our reading data. Those notes I took in the tents while hiking back in 2009 still exist, somewhere, locked inside the Kindle ecosystem...But they don’t exist, for example, as a simple text file, easily searchable, on any device or computer" (Mod). The reason for this stems from DRM (digital rights management) software, something rooted within corporate red tape which seeks to maintain older ways of doing things in the new digital ecology. The business side refuses to move forward, embracing what is financially beneficial to them rather than what is beneficial to the reader and the development of the form. 

While major companies like amazon may be avoiding such development, individual artists and creators are not. Such a case is present in Elika Ortega's "Not a case of words: Textual Environments and Multimateriality Between Page and Screen". In her essay, she highliughts how Amaranth Borsuk's _Between Page and Screen_ works to create new reading environments and experiences. In particular, she highlights the interactive nature of the project, nothing how "The reader's gesture, the process of configuring the text of BPaS from its components assigns meaning to the enacted experience beyond the verbal meaning of the poems, the running of the code, and even the iconic reading of the QR codes. The poetic effect of BPaS is deposited in the very processes taking place" (Ortega). Borsuk's project pushes the boundaries found in traditional e-readers, drawing in the reader and making them part of the process itself. This is primarily possible due the conception of the book, not as an object, but as a "spatio-temporal entity in which language was complementary to the object, a part of a structure, in the process of creating meaning and, crucially, specific reading conditions" (Ortega). The human act of holding the book up to the camera, of enabling the actually reading and creation of the text is a literalization of his process, as its through the readers gestures and physicality that the abstract barcodes become legible text. 


Borsuk herself explores this idea at length in the final chapter of _The Book_, which provides a survey of experimental "artist books" and other works which push at our conception of what constitutes a book. Her examples range from more artistic projects such as Alison Knowles, "The Big Book"--in which readers/visitors must literally enter the book as an environment, thus "immersing them in a different scene. To get from one to the next, one might crawl through a four-foot tunnel of grass" (Amaranth)--to simple choose your own adventure novels where the traditional linear form of the novel is fractured and left to the reader to the unravel. 

These readings, including Bois' “What Football Will Look Like in the Future”  all raise questions about what is possible for the actual form of the book itself, where is it going and where has it been? But they also raise issues about why the digital evolution of the book is so limited. Is it due to simple corporate interests? Or, as Bois suggests, due a deeper need and fear within humanity to push itself into new and different territories and modes of being? Is it possible that the book as it is traditionally conceived of, simply is the perfect form for conveying this kind of information?
