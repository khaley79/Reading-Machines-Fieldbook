#Week 3

Chesnutt, Charles W. “Baxter’s Procustes”. _Atlantic Monthly_, 1904.

Chesnutt's short story satirized the Bodelian Club, an organization of book collectors invested in the idea of books as aesthetics objects. Chesnutt's story highlights and criticizes this fetishization of the book, through an incident involving a book titled, “Baxter’s Procustes.” Chesnutt ultimately reveals the book to be entirely blank, several group members discussing the power of the text. This emphasized the idea, “To the true collector, a book is a work of art, of which the contents are no more important than the words of an opera” (792). Essentially, the form is more important than the content to the point where so called book lovers never actually open the book. The story not only ridicules the idea of a book as an aesthetic object, but it also connects to contemporary collector markets. Perhaps the most notbale parrallel is the comic collectors market, where people buy comics and have them “slabbed” and “graded” without ever opening or reading them, treating them as investments and aesthetic objects rather than actual texts.


Darton, Robert. “What is the History of Books?”. _Modern Natural History_ 4, 3, Cambridge University Press, 2007. 

Darton argues that the history of book studies has been fragmented by specialization over the years. To correct this, he suggests focusing on three main questions, “How do books come into being? How do they reach readers? What do readers make of them?” (495). The essay sheds light on the many threads that go into examing book history, highlighting the ways differing elements ranging from politics to the weather can affect the publishing of a text, and situates the book within through the social relations that go into its publication.


Price, Leah. ‬“Introduction” and “Reader’s Block”. _How to Do Things in Books with Victorian Britain_, Princeton University Press, 2012.

Price’s two chapters pick up the ideas of Darton’s essay, and Chesnutt’s short story, with regards to how people treat books as an aesthetic object rather than caring about its content. Price assert that there have historically been three  for books: read (“verbal content”), handling (“their material form”), and circulation (“the social and antisocial practices that they enabled and even prompted”). She then explores the different ways in which a books content can draw attention to the materiality of the format, and how scholars’ understanding of the books physicallity has changed over the centures. This particularly impacts the ways in which books are read, and the idea of reading the reading of books, who is reading the books, and much, much, more.  


Drucker, Johanna. “Preliminary 1. Histories of the Book and Literacy Technologies” and “Preliminary 2. Bibliographical Alterities”. _History of the Book_, 

The first two chapters to Drucker's _History of the Book_ examine differing ways to view said history. In “Preliminary 1,” she argues for an expanded understanding of book history, noting how the three major models of book history developed in response to one another. She ultimately feels that expanding our conception of what a book is, allowing for alternate models of writing practices which “let go of ‘progressive’ versions of cultural development in which literacy moves from oral to written to print and then other communications media” (9). She continues to pursue this thread with “Preliminary 2,” which focuses on the need to “de-colonize” the way scholars think about books and book histories so they may include non-Western writing systems and technologies. 


Pressman, Jessica. “The Aesthetic of Bookishness in Twenty-First Century Literature”. _Michigan Quarterly Review_, Univeristy of Michigan, 2009.

Pressman’s article argues “as the codex cedes its dominance as a form of information access to other media formats, book-bound content becomes more associated with the literary” (2). Essentially, as the codex/book becomes one of many ways to access a text (e-books, audio books, etc), what appears in the book format becomes favored and privelaged through an association with literarture. However, through her close reading of Steven Hall’s _Raw Shark Texts_, she examines how this fear of the digital and new can ultimately be harmful, and suggests one needs to find ways to use formats in new and novel ways. _Raw Shark Texts_ does this by highlighting the books aesthetic aspects while also prompting readers to rethink their relationship to textual formats.
