#Week 8

Blake, William. “The Tyger,” _Songs of Innocence and of Experience_, 1789.

I’m not entirely sure what I should be looking for here, or how I should be citing each individual instance of it, so forgive me for the abbreviated bibliographical entry. For the purpose of this comparison, I selected Songs of Innocence and of ExperienceCopy B (from the British Museum), Songs of Innocence and of Experience Copy C (from the Library of Congress), Songs of Innocence and of Experience Copy T (from the British Museum). 

The most immediately noticeable difference between the three is the coloring. While Copy B and Copy C both have similar textual colors--a yellowish gold for the text--Copy T’s text is presented in a dark green. In all three cases the tiger's patterning and the artwork of the tree which forms the right hand page border are all colored very differently. Copy T is the most notable in this regard, with the tiger being a veritable rainbow of colors, ranging from white, reddish brown, yellow, black, and blue. the coloring also seems to have altered the tiger's head structure in Copy T, with the head shape and eyes looking a bit more realistic vs. the more cartoonishly large and open eyes of Copy B and Copy C. Copy T also has a far more heavily colored background and tree/border. While Copy B employs the most white, with the tiger's stripes being black with some minor coloration added, and the tree itself is lightly colored with the base being primarily white. In the case of Copy C, the coloring skews towards yellow or gold, a coloring choice which continues onto the tiger itself, whose furs contains splotches of yellow or gold, perhaps connecting it to the text of the poem. In all three cases, the tree's branches seemingly act to break up the poem into individual stanzas, in addition to providing a framing and border separating the poem and artwork from the rest of the page. The tree in Copy T is heavily detailed, and the brown branches give way to a vegetative green, suggesting leaves, moss, or similar plant form. Further, the dark purple background behind the tiger is suggestive of the night described in the opening lines of the poem.


Blake, William. “London,” _Songs of Innocence and of Experience_, 1789. 

For this comparison, I chose Songs of Innocence and of Experience Copy E (from the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens), Songs of Innocence and of Experience Copy C (from the Library of Congress), and Songs of Innocence and of Experience Copy L (from the Yale Center For British Art). 

The squiggly line at the bottom of the page looks merely line like in Copy C and Copy L, appearing like an object more than anything else. In Copy E, however, it takes on a snake like form thanks to the strong line work on the bottom border of its shape, and the oddly segmented pattern in its coloring. Copy E also has the most clear and readable text, while the light, sky blue coloring and the man kneeling by the fire are all immediately comprehensible to the eye (ie. there's not confusion about what you’re looking at), though the fire’s shape could also be interpreted as a living creature.. This is not the case with Copy C or Copy L. While Copy C’s text looks as if it has faded over time, it’s fire is more immediately recognizable as a fire. Furthermore, the figure kneeling by it looks like a young boy, while Copy E’s figure appears to be an older man. Copy L is vastly different from either of the other two. The text and the artwork has a thick, black, linework, which helps the text stand out from the art, but it also results in the accompanying taking on a blocky, heavy appearance. This is especially noticeable in the banner artwork at the top of the poem, where the lines in the brick work, the old man’s clothes, and even the fire all take on new, strange appearances, while also conveying a sense of heaviness and weight.


Cordell, Ryan. ““Q i-tjb the Raven”: Taking Dirt OCR Seriously.” _Book History_, vol. 20, 2017, pp. 188-225.

Cordell argues that the provenance and history of digital editions of a text require just as much, if not more, attention than their material brethren. The argument is predicated upon the errors that can occur during the digitization process due to the quirks and intricacies of various programs such as OCR. Another layer is added to the process, as many older documents--such as newspapers--may only exist on microfilm, thus adding more potential for mistakes as the microfilm conversion process has its own quirks and limitations. These various layers serve to mediate readers interactions with the texts. This is all an issue, Cordell argues, because of the tendency to treat the digital text as synonymous with the material text, despite these layers of mediation. Knowing, understanding, and citing the provenance and history of a texts digitization can help in analyzing these texts. Further, they can provide insight in the era, institution, and methods which created them. He cites a compelling example in the form of digitized newspapers, noting how certain methodologies combined with restrictions on access to the original material, and federal grant restrictions, institutional biases, and more have resulted in a lack of “black” newspapers being digitized. In turn, this serves to reinforce certain views and prejudices regarding the place and capabilities of African Americans in our history, rendering an important aspect of their history invisible.
