#Week 2

Borsuk, Amaranth. “The Book as Object”. _The Book_, 2018.

Borsuk examines the history of print media and the development of writing. These range from the cuniform, clay tablets to khipu (knots and strings), and more. He explores the way various methods and forms of media were spread and combined to produce what we ultimately think of today as a book. Of particular note is the interaction between the development of written languages and the way the technology used influenced the form the written language would take. Examples include the thin narrow bamboo scrolls used in China which led to the development of a written langauge with a vertical structure. This echoes certain ideas from McGill’s “Format,” which focused on the materiality of a format and what that says about the media it contains. It’s easy to imagine digital technology obscuring the origins of the vertical aspect of certain languages. 


Chun, Wendy Hui Kyong. “The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future Is a Memory.” _Critical Inquiry_, vol. 35, no. 1, 2008, pp. 148–171. _JSTOR_, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/595632.

Chun examines the way rapid development of technology affects scholarship. Of primary interest is her exploration of how digital sources and archives serve to provide the illusion of permanence when, in actuality digital information is constantly decaying and impermanent. The idea echoes the description of Matthew Kirschenbaum’s essay from N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman's “Making, Critique: A Media Framework”. This highlights the ephemerality of digital media when compared to more traditional print based media, as discussed within the other readings. Thinking about this ephemerality in conjunction with McGill’s idea of format influencing or reflecting the place of a text  (media?) within society raises questions about how contemporary society values the information it stores in digital formatting.

Loeb, David and Carl Schlesinger. _Farewell: ETAOIN SHRDLU_. New York Times Company, 1980. 

This short film focuses on the last day the New York Times utilized the linotype machine to print their papers. The switch to computers has some immediately noticeable effects within the company, beyond the obvious layoffs, scenes of the linotype publication process emphasized communication and teamwork, while the scenes of the computerized publication process often featured employees silently staring at computer screens with little human interaction. Even when discussing the new, computerized printing processes, however, the narrator emphasizes the manpower aspect and insists that it’s human labor which makes the technology function.


McGill, Meredith L. “Format.” _Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal_, vol. 16, no., 4, 2018.

Format and it’s relationship to the intended market/audience (ie. different sized books for different people and purposes). Medium is a more general term, while format draws attention to the physicality of the object (ie. size, paper, cover material, etc.). It examines the message behind the format, how it can be seen to imply the intended audience and market. Further disccuses how different formats become associated with different genres of writing (ie. the size and cover designs of the Harlequin Romance Novels from our first class). It raises the question of what is lost in the adoption of digital formats which strip the materiality and format from texts, distorting or hiding their social role and value. 


Uzanne, Octave. _The End of Books_. The Univeristy of Adelaide Library, 2004.

Uzanne’s speculative look at the future of the arts was apparently intended as a satire, but does a fairly good job at predicting technological advances that have occured in the past 20 or 30 years, with a few notable differences. His emphasis on the human desire for comfort, which motivates his speculative widespread adoption of audio book technology, also touches upon the materiality on printed works. He notes how reading newspapers requires certain muscle positions, and that the books of his era required the reader to cut open individual pages. This touches upon several of McGill’s examples, particularly Benjamin Franklin’s failure to sell a lengthy, multi-volume work, which prompted him to re-release it in a single volume in an abridge edition.
