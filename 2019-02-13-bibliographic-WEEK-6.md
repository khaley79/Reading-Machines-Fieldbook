#Week 6


Faithfull, Emily. “Women Compositors.” _English Woman’s Journal_, 1861.

Emily Faithfull's article, “Women Compositors,” sheds light on the state of women in the workplace during the Victoria era, with particularly attention paid to the publisher she helped found, The Victoria Press. Unsurprisingly, the arguments against women working in publishing houses where based upon bizzarre misogynistic logic, notably “the business requires the application of a mechanical mind, and the female mind is not mechanical” (38). The rationale echoes the reasoning one sometimes hears in current discussions regarding the lack of women in STEM careers or courses; women simply can’t or aren’t interested in math and science. This is clearly wrong headed thinking and, as Faithfull points out, was disproved every day the Victoria Press is open. Perhaps the most surprsing and interesting aspect of the article was the way in which it served, not only as a call for better employment oppurtunities for women, but as a call for the betterment of women’s position within Victorian society in general. Faithfull emphasized “the necessity of an early training" and highlighted how infantilization of women ultimtely hurt them when, due to “the death of their father, or some unforeseen calamity, are plunged into utter destitution, at an age when it is difficult...to acquire new habits of life, and which leaves them not time to learn a business which shall support them” (40). This call for education and gainful employment for women in a business that was traditionally considered a man’s domain represents an early strain of feminism, and one which saw women writing, publishing, and distributing work aimed at women’s concerns. To a certain degree, it echoes and foreshadows the later ’zine scene of the 90s, which was the birthplace of the riot girl movement and helped introduce a generation of American teen girls to feminism. 


Kirschenbaum, Matthew G. “Introduction: It Is Known” and “Word Processing as a Literary Subject.” _Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing_, The Belknap Press Of Harvard University Press, 2016.

Both chapters from Kirschenbaum’s book, _Track Changes_, examine the ways in which technology can alter our relationship with the text we compose. Kirschenbaum draws from a wide variety of sources to track this concept throughout history and literary studies in a way which echoes many of our of our other readings so far. This look at how technology alters the way we compose text seems especially relevant to our course given that much of the writing we’ve done so far has been mediated via technology and a specific programming language, Markdown. Both the language and the technology used can be seen to have an affect on the way we compose these bibliographical entries. While I'm unsure about what tools the other students are using--thought I vaguely recall someone mentioning composing in TextEdit and C&Ping it from there--I’ve been using Oxygen, which conviently has the ability create md files from scratch. It also contains a nifty “preview” window that allows me to see the Markdown coding in action. On the downside, it means my screen size tends to be fairly small, making it a little more difficult to properly judge how long a paragraph actually is, or how long certain quotes are. In turn, these effect how I compose the entries, forcing me to sometimes engage in editing after the fact to keep my entries from exploding in size. 


M.M.H. “A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy: A Visit to the Victoria Printing Press.” _English Woman's Journal_, 1860.

Written a year before Faithfull’s article, M.M.H.’s “A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy” provides a glimpse into one woman’s reaction to the Victoria Press, and one which emphasizes the way it may actually serve to continue certain gendered labor roles for women. Framed around Mrs. Grundy’s tour of the Victoria Press, on several occassions the article puts forth a division of labor built upon genderd lines. Moments such as, “The compositors’ trade should be in the hands of women only. They are eminently suited to it, and it is eminently suited to them” and the passage which appeasr shortly after, “compositors’ work for women, theimposition and press-work for men” (271). Grundy is ultimately unimpressed by the apparent progress being made on behalf of women, and ultimately criticizes the scene claiming it is “Clearly women’s work, and if you want me to say more in favor of your pet Journal you must show me something very different to this” (272). The emphasis on the manual labor is something Grundy sees as “women’s work.” While women may be at the center of the production process, and may be getting paid for their labor, they are still doing a form of manual labor predicated upon their manual dexterity, a typically feminine trait which therefore mark their labor as “women’s work”.  


Ratner, Joshua. “Paratexts.” _Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal_, vol. 16, no. 4, 2018.

Ratner’s discussions about “Paratexts” highlights aspects of book publishing that are often overlooked or ignored by most readers. He elaborates on the ways in which things ranging from spine text, copyright indicia, titles pages, advertisements, prefaces, footnotes, and more. Using the work of Gerad Genette, Ratner further breaks this category down into two primary types, “peritexts”--a text “that is part of or embedded in the same volume as the body text”--and “epitexts”--a text which “occurs first outside the volume that contains the body text” (734). Ratner explains the way both types of text alter and change the way we interact with the main text, and provides several examples of how authors employed each kind of text to specifically alter the way readers encountered the main text itself. The terms seem especially useful for identifying the different relationships between various sorts of texts, and the framing of the paratext as a symbiosis which “offers a...useful frame because it acknowledges that texts and their paratexts interact in sometimes parasitic and sometimes mutualistic ways” (735). In examining this week’s readings, it is possible to see "The Victoria Press" article as an epitext to several of the publications and work it mentions as being published by the Victoria Press. Furthermore, the articles and discussion surrounding the existence of the Victoria Press could function as an epitext, causing readers to either seek out their work or avoid it based upon their feelings regarding women working in publishers.  


“The Victoria Press,” _Illustrated London News_, 15 June 1861.

This 1861 article highlights the first year anniversary of the Victoria Press, and notes how it “has therefore stood the test of one years’s work and has triumphed over all the preliminary difficulties with which such an undertaking could not fail to be attended” (“The Victoria Press”). It further praises their work and serves to invite visitors to “inspect the establishment” during select hours. The article is accompanied by an image which shows women of various ages busily at work in the printing office. Notably, all the women are still conforming to the gendered clothing standards of the era. While this might not be terribly surprising, when taken in context with M.M.H.’s “A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy” it could be seen as reinforcing the idea of the labor being “women’s work”. It challenges certain expectations of what women are capable of, but it does not do much to push back against the fundamental idea of what it means to be a woman at the time it occurred. They were working in an area that was traditionally male dominated, but they did so in a way that still emphasized their femininity rather than pushing at heteronormative performance of their gender.


Werner, Sarah. “Finding Women in the Printing Shop.” _Wynken de Worde_, 2014.

Werner’s blog article, “Finding Women in the Printing Shop,” acts as a nice companion to the Ranter’s piece as it delves into what kind of information can be found in the paratext of a publication. In the case of _The Mothers Legacie, To her vnborne Childe_, Werner uncovers a history of women within the London publishing industry, “we’ve seen women in nearly all the roles associated with making books: a woman wrote it, a woman published it, a woman speculated with it, and a woman printed it. If we’d just been looking at the title pages of the book, we would have only seen two of those women, Jocelin and Barret. What a rich history we would miss!” By examining the paratext, Werner has uncovered evidence which challenges our understanding of women and their place within the early publishing industry. In a sense, it functions similar to the articles about the Victoria Press in that it forces readers to reconsider their understanding of pre-20th century eras and the role women had within them.
