# Lab Report 5

**Prompt**

Let’s leave the response for today open, but keep a particular eye on the week’s readings and ways you can connect our ongoing work with type to those historical and literary touchstones.


**Actual Lab Report Writing**

I'm a little unsure about what reading’s to tie this particularly lab report to, due to the storm which caused it be rescheduled--something which also saw our readings for the following week shortened--but I’ll attempt to connect it with various readings.

This was the first lab where we worked on type setting our own personal projects. In my case I chose four short lines based from the English translation of Pablo Neruda’s “Tonight I Can Write (The Saddest Lines),‟ including the famous line, “Love is so short, forgetting is so long”. For the type face I chose an 18pt script (cursive) font. While the type setting portion was fairly straightforward, one thing that was noticeable as the work went on was the weight of everything. Given that the primary tools used in moveable type are metal or lead, this shouldn’t be too shocking, yet lifting and carrying the California Job Case full of the letters and the type galley were surprisingly heavy. While the weight shouldn’t necessarily have anything to do with gender, it did make me think of our various readings on the Victoria Press and the issue of gender roles and who should do what work when it comes to printing. 

In particular, I kept coming back to MMH’s “A Ramble With Mrs. Grundy”. While we had discussed the way it was intended to be a satire, I still find it difficult to view the end of the story where Grundy kept repeating, “Clearly woman’s work, and if you want me to say more in favor of you pet Journal you must show me something very different to this,” as anything other than a commentary on the nature of the work the women were doing at the Victoria Press, and how it was still gendered to play to concepts surrounding women’s strengths. This is further emphasized when it comes to the division of labor within the Victoria Press, where “The compositors’ trade should be in the hands of women only” while “To the men belong the imposition and press-work”. The women handled the easy, meditative aspects which focused on manual dexterity, while the men quite literally do the heavy lifting and hammering--lifting that left me wondering how hefting those boxes and galleys around on a regular basis would affect my arm strength in addition to providing me with a creative outlet. The actual doing of the work really emphasized why the Victoria Press would divide the work in this way, given the gender politics and acceptable gender roles of the era. It’s hard to imagine the society of the time accepting what such lifting would do to a woman’s body, when the very idea of women working in the press at all was deemed controversial.

At the same time, the focus on women doing the more manually dexterous labor, and the focus on how it was “better than the tedious stitch, stitch, stitch, of the poor seamstress, better for health of mind and body” simply served to obscure the deleterious effects it could actually have. While it may have been meditative in our brief lab session, there is a big difference between doing it for an hour or two once a week, and doing it for eight or more hours a day, seven days a week. In our short time my fingers were positively black from the ink and grime of the type. Doing that repeatedly for that often must have permanently stained their fingers, and must have worn down their finger prints, affected their nail beds, and more. Not to mention the way such repetitive action itself can also have unhealthy side effects, such as muscle strain, joint problems, minor cuts from the sharp metal edges, and of course... the fact that they were constantly handling lead. Thus, while MMH’s article on one hand seems to challenge the division of labor, both Grundy’s reaction and the words of those giving the tour seemingly downplay the actual physicality of the labor the women were being subjected to. A physicality that I feel might get lost from our own, all too brief encounter with type setting.
