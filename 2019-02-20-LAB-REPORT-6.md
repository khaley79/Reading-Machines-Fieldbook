# Lab Report 6

**Prompt**

In this final letterpress lab report, I want you to think about our work with type and the press in the context of our course’s ongoing discussions of media, book history, and technology. How does physically working with this historical technology change your view of the handpress period and its texts? Think back to the books we have looked at in the archives or in Prof. Cordell’s collections presented in class. How might your fuller, embodied understanding of how those books were created help you think about them anew? What new meanings might those media carry now that you better understand their means of production? Do the experiences of the past few weeks give you any new interpretive purchase when thinking about historical texts?


**Actual Lab Report Writing**

The past several weeks of lab work and reading have seen us examine archival books, while also engaging in type setting and operating a hand press. While engaging in such hands on work has helped me gain a new appreciation for the amount of time and effort that went into producing book--including several of the larger volume we examined in the Snell archives--it also given me a new appreciation for the level of coordination required to produce works of such length. When considering the problems we encountered in assembling just a few lines of text, the idea of coordinating numerous type setters, each working on a different page, seems positively massive. To say nothing of the material costs that went into producing the book, such as space, paper, and enough of the same type set to properly produce the book. When taking all of this into consideration, it's easy to understand why the bread and butter of many printers weren't books, but shorter documents such as broadsides, official documents, etc. 

With all that taken into account, it does alter the way one looks at some of the archival texts we've encountered. For each books, regardless of how large or small, there must have been questions of cost, return, and investment. It calls into question the parameters that lead to a book coming into existence at all, and turns it into something that resembles modern book publishing with complex questions of audience, the potential interest it may generate, and how much profit the printer could make off of it. However, as we also read, there were ways for printers to offset the costs of printing through co-productions with other printers, investors, subscribers (an early example of the pre-order system, perhaps?). 

Thinking about book printing in these terms emphasizes ideas expressed by Donald F. McKenzie in his piece, “The Book as an Expressive Form”, from _Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts_. In particular, thinking about these issues serves to correct a common error McKenzie identifies in his essay, namely, the ways in which the history of the book often excludes the "study of the social, economic, and political motivations of publishing, the reasons why texts were written and read as they were, why they were rewritten and redesigned, or allowed to die" (13). McKenzie asserts that ignoring such issues renders any examination of book history into "a feebly degressive book list and never rise to a readable history" (13). Taking this approach emphasizes the various choices and obstacles one would have to overcome when printing a book, and more importantly, it forces on to consider the obstacles an author would have to negotiate in order to get a work of theirs published. It makes apparent the gatekeeper-ish nature of printing during this era, something which in turn begs for comparison to our own contemporary printing and publishing methods, and how these further effect to spread and dissemination of written works. 

One of the most obvious differences between the type setting era and our modern one, is the existence of things such as print-on-demand and digital publishing; printing methods which arguably democratize the printing/publishing process, opening it up to those of lower income levels or without access to the kinds of social networks that made printing possible in the early centuries.
