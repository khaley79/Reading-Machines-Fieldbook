# Lab Report 4

**Prompt**

In your lab report this week, you could use this as a launching point for thinking about the materiality of print culture. How does recognizing text as composed—quite literally—of material letter sorts, spaces, and leading refigure our view of print culture? How does this form of textual production and labor relate to other modes we have studied? And how might it reshape our understanding of the artifacts produced through these media?

**Actual Lab Report Writing**

In setting the first line of _A Printer’s Epitaph_, I was immediately struck by how similar it felt to the second lab’s exercise of writing by candlelight. In both cases there was a strangely meditative quality about the exercise that likely the result of the single minded focus on a repetitive task. In both instances, the class was working as a group, but in each case the tactile and manual aspect of the work made it very easy to slide in a silent, almost automatic, rhythm. At the same time, however, the overall system does seem like it must be a highly social and interactive one. While we (the students) may have been laboring in isolation, an actual print house would involve multipe steps that were not included in our lab. Indeed, the actual environment of the printing house must have more closely resembled the scenes of newspaper production as shown in “Farewell etaoin shrdlu,” with editors involed and discussing layouts, hammering and screwing the type into place, verbal co-ordination of the various parts of the process, and similar collaborative moments and discussions. 

Similarly, our lab experience seems to clash with Franklin’s account of the social and lively atmosphere of the print shops he worked at, particluarly the British print shop. The silent, isolated work we were engaged with flies in the face of a workplace culture which “had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen” (Franklin). While having an alehouse boy does not automatically imply a loud, rowdy, drunken atmosphere, Franklin’s description about the drinking habits of his co-workers certainly seem to an atmosphere that was far from quiet and contemplative, “My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work” (Franklin). Admittedly, Frankly also emphasizes how these print houses were inefficient, but it is difficult to imagine how anyone could drink so much and still retain the manual dexterity required by the work and makes me wonder how any of these people held down jobs beyond the first week.

It’s worth noting that these differences are tied to their individual historical contexts. For example, for our lab we were college students at a university, in a part of the school primarily dedicated to faculty offices. Had this been a functioning publishing house during the 19th century or earlier, the situation would be far closer to a typical workspace with deadlines. Once again, the situation would more closely resemble that from “Farewell etaoin shrdlu,” rather than a library. Which raises a very interesting questions about the lab in general. Namely, how accurate are our impressions of the work? How does our understanding of the printing and publishing process differ from the lived reality of the eras this technology is from? Are we gaining an accurate understanding of the technology and its use?
